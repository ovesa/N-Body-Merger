# N-Body-Merger

Using the equations of motion in conjunction with a constant time-step leap-frog integration scheme (KDK, Kick Drift Kick), I explore the dynamics of two merging elliptical galaxies. Each galaxy is composed of 20,000 equally massed particles. 

The n-body simulation was done in Fortran while the plotting was done in Python.
